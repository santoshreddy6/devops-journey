## Linux File System (Day 02)

Linux follows a hierarchical file system starting from root (/).

### Important Directories

/        → Root directory (base of everything)
/etc     → Configuration files
/var     → Variable data
/var/log → System and application logs
/home    → User home directories
/usr     → Installed software and libraries
/tmp     → Temporary files

### Notes
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file
- Logs are mainly stored under /var/log
- Configuration files are mostly under /etc
